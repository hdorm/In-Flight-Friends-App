# In-Flight-Friends-App
Repository to store code for the app portion of the project.

App is currently in prototype form. We still need to find a workaround to group users by flight or WiFi network.

The only other components missing from the current code are those that rely upon a method to group users together such as checking the user's emoji against other users and retrieving previous messages from the database.
